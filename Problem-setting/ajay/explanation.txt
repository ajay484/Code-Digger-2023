Explanation:


Sort the movies in descending order of happiness per minute (happiness divided by length).
Iterate through the sorted list:
If the remaining time is sufficient for the current movie, add its happiness to the total and subtract its length from the remaining time.
Continue iterating until the remaining time is insufficient for any remaining movie.
The final total happiness represents the optimal solution.
